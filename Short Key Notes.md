#PageCaches: In computing, a **page cache**, sometimes also called [disk cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_cache_(disambiguation) "Disk cache (disambiguation)"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache#cite_note-1) is a transparent [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing) "Cache (computing)") for the [pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory) "Page (computer memory)") originating from a [secondary storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_storage "Secondary storage") device such as a [hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive "Hard disk drive") (HDD) or a [solid-state drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive "Solid-state drive") (SSD). The [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") keeps a page cache in otherwise unused portions of the [main memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory "Main memory") (RAM), resulting in quicker access to the contents of cached pages and overall performance improvements. A page cache is implemented in [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science) "Kernel (computer science)") with the [paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging "Paging") memory management, and is mostly transparent to applications.
