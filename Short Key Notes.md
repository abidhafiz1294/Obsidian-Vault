### #PageCaches: 

In computing, a **page cache**, sometimes also called [disk cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_cache_(disambiguation) "Disk cache (disambiguation)"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache#cite_note-1) is a transparent [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing) "Cache (computing)") for the [pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory) "Page (computer memory)") originating from a [secondary storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_storage "Secondary storage") device such as a [hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive "Hard disk drive") (HDD) or a [solid-state drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive "Solid-state drive") (SSD). The [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") keeps a page cache in otherwise unused portions of the [main memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory "Main memory") (RAM), resulting in quicker access to the contents of cached pages and overall performance improvements. A page cache is implemented in [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science) "Kernel (computer science)") with the [paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging "Paging") memory management, and is mostly transparent to applications.

### #edge-computing :

Edge computing refers to a distributed computing model where data processing and storage are performed closer to the edge of the network, near the source of data generation. In edge computing, instead of sending all data to a centralized cloud or data center, processing and analysis are done locally on edge devices or edge servers. This approach offers several benefits:

1. Reduced Latency: By processing data locally at the edge, edge computing minimizes the latency caused by sending data back and forth to a remote data center. This is crucial for applications that require real-time or near-real-time processing, such as IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
    
2. Bandwidth Optimization: Edge computing reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to the cloud or data center, optimizing network bandwidth. This is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or expensive network connectivity, such as remote locations or areas with poor internet connectivity.
    
3. Enhanced Security: Edge computing can enhance data security by keeping sensitive data local and reducing the exposure to potential threats that may exist in the cloud or during data transmission. It allows organizations to implement security measures closer to the data source and maintain better control over data privacy.
    
4. Offline Operation: Edge devices can continue to operate and process data even when they are disconnected from the central infrastructure. This is beneficial in scenarios where network connectivity is intermittent or unreliable.
    
5. Scalability and Reliability: Edge computing enables distributed computing resources across multiple edge devices or edge servers, providing scalability and redundancy. It reduces the load on the centralized infrastructure and improves overall system reliability.

*conclusion:*
 	Edge computing is applicable in various industries and use cases, including smart cities, industrial IoT, healthcare, retail, autonomous vehicles, and more. By bringing computing capabilities closer to where data is generated, edge computing enables faster and more efficient processing, enabling real-time decision-making and enabling new applications and services.


### #orchestration :

 Orchestration is **the automated configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems, applications, and services**. Orchestration helps IT to more easily manage complex tasks and workflows.
