### Introduction

**Kubernetes**, a container #orchestration system, has become the *overwhelming standard for managing complex container workloads in production environments*.

> 
> **Container orchestration** is a term for software that allows operators to run groups of containers across multiple hosts. These systems coordinate with container runtimes to manage the life cycle of containerized workloads and operate an entire supporting environment for containers to create a scalable platform for deployment.
>  In short, container orchestration systems are designed to create a complete management environment that takes care of the hard work of operating containers with production requirements.
