## Introduction
The Linux file system software implementation is an important component of the Linux operating system. It provides a way for the operating system to store and organize data on various storage devices, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, and network storage.

## Linux File System Structure

Linux file system has a hierarchal file structure as it contains a root directory and its subdirectories. All other directories can be accessed from the root directory. A partition usually has only one file system, but it may have more than one file system.

A file system is designed in a way so that it can manage and provide space for non-volatile storage data. All file systems required a namespace that is a naming and organizational methodology. The namespace defines the naming process, length of the file name, or a subset of characters that can be used for the file name. It also defines the logical structure of files on a memory segment, such as the use of directories for organizing the specific files. Once a namespace is described, a Metadata description must be defined for that particular file.

The data structure needs to support a hierarchical directory structure; this structure is used to describe the available and used disk space for a particular block. It also has the other details about the files such as file size, date & time of creation, update, and last modified.

Also, it stores advanced information about the section of the disk, such as partitions and volumes.

The advanced data and the structures that it represents contain the information about the file system stored on the drive; it is distinct and independent of the file system metadata.

## Implementation

Linux file system contains two-part file system software implementation architecture. Consider the below image:

 HERE, some filesystem types in linux: ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, hpfs, iso9660, JFS, minix,msdos, ncpfs nfs, ntfs, proc, Reiserfs, smb, sysv, umsdos, vfat, XFS, xiafs 

The file system requires an API (Application programming interface) to access the function calls to interact with file system components like files and directories. **API** facilitates tasks such as creating, deleting, and copying the files. It facilitates an algorithm that defines the arrangement of files on a file system.

The first two parts of the given file system together called a **Linux virtual file system**. It provides a single set of commands for the kernel and developers to access the file system. This virtual file system requires the specific system driver to give an interface to the file system.
