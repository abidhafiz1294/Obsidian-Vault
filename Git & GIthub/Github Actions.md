### Intro
GitHub Actions are a powerful feature that allows developers to automate various workflows related to software development and deployment. Here are some reasons why GitHub Actions are needed:

1. Automation: GitHub Actions allows developers to automate various tasks related to software development, such as building and testing code, deploying applications, and creating release packages.
    
2. Collaboration: GitHub Actions allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project and work on different tasks simultaneously. Actions can be used to create workflows that automate tasks for each developer, allowing them to focus on their respective work.
    
3. Efficiency: GitHub Actions enables developers to streamline their workflow and eliminate manual tasks, which saves time and improves productivity.
    
4. Customization: GitHub Actions is highly customizable and can be tailored to suit individual project needs. Developers can create their custom actions or use pre-built actions from the GitHub Marketplace.
    
5. Integration: GitHub Actions can integrate with other tools and services such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Slack, making it easier to build, test, and deploy applications.
    

Overall, GitHub Actions provide an easy and efficient way to automate various aspects of software development, saving time and improving collaboration between developers.
